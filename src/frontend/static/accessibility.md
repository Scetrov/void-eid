## 1. Commitment

The VoID eID team is committed to ensuring digital accessibility for people with disabilities. We are continually improving the user experience for everyone and applying the relevant accessibility standards.

## 2. Technologies Used

Accessibility of VoID eID relies on the following technologies to work with the particular combination of web browser and any assistive technologies or plugins installed on your computer:

* **HTML5** (Semantic structure)
* **CSS** (Scalable layouts)
* **React 19** (Dynamic updates)

## 3. Accessibility Features

* **Keyboard Navigation:** We strive to ensure all interactive elements (buttons, form inputs) are accessible via keyboard tab order.
* **Color Contrast:** We utilize a design system designed to meet contrast ratios for readability.
* **Semantic Markup:** We use standard HTML5 landmarks (`<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`) to aid screen readers.
